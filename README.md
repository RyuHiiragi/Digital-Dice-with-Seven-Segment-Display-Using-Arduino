# Digital Dice with Seven-Segment Display Using Arduino

This repository contains the Arduino code, configuration, and assembly instructions for building a digital dice using an Arduino and a seven-segment display. The system generates random numbers (1â€“6) and displays them on the seven-segment display, mimicking the behavior of a traditional dice <button class="citation-flag" data-index="9">. This project is ideal for beginners and hobbyists who want to explore basic electronics and programming.

## Overview
The digital dice uses a seven-segment display to show random numbers generated by the Arduino. When a push button is pressed, the Arduino generates a random number between 1 and 6 and displays it on the seven-segment display <button class="citation-flag" data-index="4">. This project is a great way to learn about random number generation, digital output control, and basic electronics.

## Components Used
To build this digital dice, you will need the following components:
- **Arduino Uno**
- **Common Cathode Seven-Segment Display**
- **Tactile Push Button**
- **220Î© Resistors**
- **Breadboard**
- **Jumper Wires**

## System Dimensions
For an ideal digital dice:
- **Height**: 10â€“15 cm
- **Width**: 10â€“15 cm
- **Length**: 10â€“15 cm

These dimensions ensure that the system is compact yet spacious enough to house all components.

## Assembly Instructions
Follow these detailed steps to assemble your digital dice:

1. **Prepare the Seven-Segment Display**
   - Connect the seven-segment display to the Arduino using the following pin configuration:
     - **Segment a** â†’ Digital Pin 2
     - **Segment b** â†’ Digital Pin 3
     - **Segment c** â†’ Digital Pin 4
     - **Segment d** â†’ Digital Pin 5
     - **Segment e** â†’ Digital Pin 6
     - **Segment f** â†’ Digital Pin 7
     - **Segment g** â†’ Digital Pin 8
   - Use 220Î© resistors in series with each segment to limit current. For example, connect one end of a resistor to Digital Pin 2 and the other end to the "a" segment of the display. Repeat this process for all segments (aâ€“g) <button class="citation-flag" data-index="7">.

2. **Connect the Common Pin of the Seven-Segment Display**
   - If using a **common cathode** display, connect the common pin (usually labeled as "COM") to the GND pin on the Arduino.
   - If using a **common anode** display, connect the common pin to the 5V pin on the Arduino <button class="citation-flag" data-index="7">.

3. **Connect the Push Button**
   - Connect one terminal of the push button to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the other terminal to Digital Pin 9 on the Arduino.
   - Add a 10kÎ© pull-down resistor between Digital Pin 9 and GND to ensure stable input readings <button class="citation-flag" data-index="3">.

4. **Power Connections**
   - Power the system using a USB cable connected to the Arduino's power input. Ensure the USB cable provides sufficient power (5V).

5. **Final Assembly**
   - Secure all components inside a protective enclosure.
   - Position the seven-segment display and push button for easy access.
   - Double-check all connections to ensure there are no loose wires or incorrect pin assignments.

## Arduino Code Explanation
The provided Arduino code generates random numbers between 1 and 6 and displays them on the seven-segment display. The code uses predefined patterns for each number to control the segments of the display <button class="citation-flag" data-index="3">. When the push button is pressed, the Arduino generates a random number and updates the display accordingly.
