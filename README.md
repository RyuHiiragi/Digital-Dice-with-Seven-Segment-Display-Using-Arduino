# Digital Dice with Seven-Segment Display Using Arduino

This repository contains the Arduino code, configuration, and assembly instructions for building a digital dice using an Arduino and a seven-segment display. The system generates random numbers (1â€“6) and displays them on the seven-segment display, mimicking the behavior of a traditional dice <button class="citation-flag" data-index="9">. This project is ideal for beginners and hobbyists who want to explore basic electronics and programming.

## Overview
The digital dice uses a seven-segment display to show random numbers generated by the Arduino. When a push button is pressed, the Arduino generates a random number between 1 and 6 and displays it on the seven-segment display <button class="citation-flag" data-index="4">. This project is a great way to learn about random number generation, digital output control, and basic electronics.

## Components Used
To build this digital dice, you will need the following components:
- **Arduino Uno**
- **Common Cathode Seven-Segment Display**
- **Tactile Push Button**
- **220Î© Resistors**
- **Breadboard**
- **Jumper Wires**

## System Dimensions
For an ideal digital dice:
- **Height**: 10â€“15 cm
- **Width**: 10â€“15 cm
- **Length**: 10â€“15 cm

These dimensions ensure that the system is compact yet spacious enough to house all components.

## Assembly Instructions
Follow these steps to assemble your digital dice:
1. Connect the seven-segment display to the Arduino using 220Î© resistors for each segment.
2. Connect the push button to the Arduino for triggering random number generation.
3. Power the system using a USB cable.
4. Secure all components inside a protective enclosure.

## Arduino Code Explanation
The provided Arduino code generates random numbers between 1 and 6 and displays them on the seven-segment display. The code uses predefined patterns for each number to control the segments of the display <button class="citation-flag" data-index="3">. When the push button is pressed, the Arduino generates a random number and updates the display accordingly.
