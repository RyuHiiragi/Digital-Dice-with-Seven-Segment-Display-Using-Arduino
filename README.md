# Digital-Dice-with-Seven-Segment-Display-Using-Arduino
This guide will walk you through building a digital dice using an Arduino and a seven-segment display. The system generates random numbers (1â€“6) and displays them on the seven-segment display, mimicking the behavior of a traditional dice. This project is ideal for beginners and hobbyists who want to explore basic electronics and programming.
